# Basic genome assembly for Ganoderma lucidum 10597-SS1
What is this: This a repository of a notebook and reports for my Ganoderma lucidum 10597-SS1 genome assembly and annotation project. 

Why is this: I have a hypothesis that long read data can improve the contiguity of the current MycoCosm genome assembly for Ganderma lucidum 10597-SS1 and I wish to practice my bioinformatics skills.

How is this: I generated a small amount of long-read data using a MinION nanopore sequencer and used that data in conjunction with the attached notebook to produce the attached reports.
